# KML-SQL-CASE-STUDY
## PROJECT TITLE: KML CASE STUDY

## Project Overview 
As a Data Analyst i was tasked with analyzing the data of a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. This task includes analyzing products and customer review data to generate insights that can guides product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement, as well as profer solutions where necessary.

## Data Source
The primary data source used for this project is the KMS case study which contains information like;
- Order Information: Quantity, Sales, Discount, Ship Mode, Product Name etc.
- Customer engagement: Shipping Date, Product Name, Customer's Name etc.
- Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values and exported to SQL server

## Tool Used üíæ:
SQL Server Script was used in completing this project. I was able to do the following;

- Data collection

- Data cleaning

- Data analysis

## Analysis Tasks
I utized a few SQL commands, extracted results, and gave insights where necessary to answer the following questions:

### 1. Which product category had the highest sales üìà?

select top 1
	Product_Category, Sales
from [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
order by Sales desc

### 11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer ‚úàÔ∏è
~~~
select [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode],
sum(Shipping_Cost) as total_shipping_cost_for_priority,
count(Distinct Order_ID) as number_of_orders_for_priority_ship_mode 
from [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
group by [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
order by [Order_Priority] asc, total_shipping_cost_for_priority desc
~~~
![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddb529a-89d8-4582-a699-ffe14688f2e5)

Answer: No, KMS did not appropriately align shipping cost with priority.

Express Air remains the best for high-priority orders, which was underused.
Delivery Truck although slower and cheaper was overused even for urgent orders.
This mismatch results in wasted cost and delayed deliveries.

## INSIGHTS
- Most Sold Category: Office Supplies
- Top Region by Sales: West
- Least Performing Region: Nunavut or Territories
- Most Profitable Segment: Consumer
- Most Costly Shipping Mode: Express Air
- Major Insight: Misalignment between order priority and shipping method caused unnecessary costs.
